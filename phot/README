This directory contains the photometry routines.  

asymptotic    - performs asymptotic fits to aperture photometry (total mags)
cgrowth       - spline curve routine
disk_int      - experimental disk integrator
draw_apert    - draws the ellipse on a frame
el            - primary photometry script (read it fool)
elapert       - elliptical aperture routine with partial pixels (slow!)
ellipse       -
old_elpert    - FORTRAN version, obsolete
quick_elapert - fast aperture photometry, no partial pixels
sfb_elapert   -
total_mag     -
