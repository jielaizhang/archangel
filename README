                           **** ARCHANGEL Galaxy Photometry Pacakage ****

This is the alpha release of ARCHANGEL, a surface photometry package for
general galaxy analysis.  Documentation is found in the /doc directory, but
it helps if you know a bit of galaxy photometry first.  See below for quick
start processes, currently the package fits ellipses, determines sky,
cleans the files of stars and other stuff, edits the ellipses, does
elliptical aperture photometry.  Use your fave image display system for
frame editing (the package is setup to use IPAC's SKYVIEW, but this is not
critical).

The package needs:

1) some favor of Unix (Solaris, Darwin or Linux have been tested) and gcc installed
2) python - version 2.3 or greater (needs os.walk)
3) a g77 compiler
4) numpy (google on these names to get the downloads)
5) pyfits
6) cfitsio (FITS subroutines for C++ and FORTRAN), in the package area
7) Pmw (1.3.2 is available)
8) matplotlib 0.98.3 (note: there are some cursor issues with newer versions of
   matplotlib, 0.98.3 is in the package directory, destroy your current version of
   matplotlib and remember to destroy the matplotlib egg in the python site-package
   area, we are working with matplotlib on this issue)

After you have installed all the above packages, install:

1) gzip -df archangel_N.N.tar.gz ; tar xvf archangel_N.N.tar ; rm archangel.tar
2) cd archangel
3) ./setup.py build or python setup.py build

This will setup a archangel/bin directory and compile and link the proper
python scripts.  You will need to add a few things to your .cshrc

set path=($path ~/archangel/bin)
setenv PYTHONPATH /Library/Python/2.5/site-packages:~/archangel/bin
setenv ARCHANGEL_HOME ~/archangel

then source your .cshrc

note: your PYTHONPATH may be different (above is OS X), check for the location of
your site-package (/usr/local?)

Also, in the archangel directory is a file called .archangel, it controls
all the information on windows (sizes and geometry on the screen).  It's
current set for a really big screen, so you might want to reduce the
geometry's (by factor of 10) if you are using a laptop.

If you have root access, you can move the entire /archangel/bin directory
to /usr/local/bin.  I reccomend keeping the archangel/bin and resetting
your path unless you believe you will be using these routines a great deal.

At this point you probably want to test the routines, especially the
graphics scripts.  Jump to the examples directory and run probe (the image
viewer) on any FITS file.  Then try gasp_images on the data.  All routines
have a -h option for help (i.e. gasp_images -h).  The graphics put up a
help window if you type '?' or 'h' in the window.

----------------

Quick Start:

Got a .fits file? (if not, grab one from examples directory) Then set your
$PATH to archangel/bin, rehash and type:

% profile file.fits -xy xc yc

where xc and yc are the pixel coords for the galaxy of interest.  If the galaxy is
in the middle of the frame, it will find it without the -xy option.  Profile will:

1) do a crude sky
2) find all the things in the frame
3) find the starting galaxy center
4) clean the frame of stuff outside the galaxy's outer edge
5) refind the galaxy center and size
6) do an initial ellipse fitting (prof is the core program)
7) clean the inner isophotes
8) fit again
9) do the sky again

The results are in file.xml, see prof/prf.header for the meaning of the .prf file

All programs can be probed with a -h option.  Scan the various directories
for useful tools, a full manual is coming Real Soon Now.

You can edit and examine the ellipses with prf_edit (needs pgplot installed)
