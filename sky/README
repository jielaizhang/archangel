This directory contains the sky routines.  

sky_box determines the mean sky in a frame through various techniques.

clean_blanks is a routine to find all the pixels in a frame with the
same value and set them to NaN.  This is necessary since some archives
use different values to represent a masked pixel (for example, zero or -32767).

sky.py - finds sky, writes to XML file
